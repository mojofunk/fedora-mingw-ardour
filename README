This is a rough list of library dependencies for building Ardour
for windows using the MinGW compiler on Fedora 19 and 20.
 
The packages contained in this repository are all the packages that
have not yet been included in Fedora.

The Sources for these packages are not included in this repository
and have to be downloaded separately and put in the SOURCES directory
of the rpmbuild root.

These packages should use the versions that are in the native Fedora
packages so an easy way to download the correct sources is with
yumdownloader and then extract the source from the package

e.g $yumdownloader --source flac

The ~/.rpmmacros file is used to set the path to the rpmbuild root
dir, rather than the default ~/rpmbuild

Jack2 is the only package that requires an unreleased version from
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2.git

These packages should be built and or installed in this order:

install wine, needed to run some tests during the configure process

install mingw*-gcc

install mingw*-gcc-c++

install mingw*-libogg

yum group install 'Development Tools'
yum group install 'RPM Development Tools'

install mingw-flac <- requires libogg

install mingw*-libvorbis

build/install mingw-libsndfile <- requires flac, vorbis
build/install mingw-libsamplerate <- requires sndfile for examples?

install mingw*-gtkmm24, this will pull in all the gtk+ deps etc

install intltool

build/install mingw-gtk2-engines <- provides clearlooks
